webhook_receiver.py is the proof-of-concept webhook receiver lambda that BHayden used in a private AWS account for prototyping. It can be used as an example for how to connect to the Box API.

In order to create the environment for the lambda, I launched an EC2 instance with the Amazon Linux 2 AMI, then followed the instructions here to setup a dependency .zip file:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html

The only install command needed for the box sdk is:
pip install "boxsdk[jwt]"
